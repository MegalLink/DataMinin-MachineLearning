These architectures build upon the traditional feedforward neural networks and introduce recurrent connections, allowing them to exhibit temporal dynamics and memory capabilities.\n\nThe Elman RNN employs a simple recurrent loop in its hidden layer, enabling it to capture short-term temporal dependencies, making it suitable for applications such as speech recognition and time series analysis.\n\nThe Jordan RNN possesses feedback connections from the output layer to the hidden layer, rendering it capable of modeling longer-term dependencies, which finds applications in machine translation and language modeling tasks.\n\nThe Bidirectional RNN combines both forward and backward temporal processing, allowing it to consider both past and future context in its predictions, making it effective in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.\nThese advanced neural network architectures significantly expand the modeling capabilities of traditional neural networks and have become indispensable tools in various sequential data processing applications.\n\nExercise\nUse the IMDB movie reviews dataset to perform sentiment analysis with a Elman, Jordan and Bidirectional RNN. Highlight the differences on the performance of each architecture.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from keras.datasets import imdb\nfrom keras.preprocessing import sequence\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Embedding, SimpleRNN, Dense, Bidirectional\nimport tensorflow as tf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-04T16:46:56.972689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-04T16:46:56.973344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-04T16:46:57.000113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-04T16:46:56.973308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-04T16:46:56.998930Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"max_features = 5000  #
